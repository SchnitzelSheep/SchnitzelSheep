- 👋 Hi, I’m @SchnitzelSheep
- 💻 I’m no coder, though I do know some foundational Javascript and Python. I believe that in the digital age, almost everyone benefits from some basic understanding of code.
- 🕵️‍♂️ I’m interested in OSINT, particularly CT/CI/CRIMINT applications, and the newest OSINT tools are usually found on GitHub.
